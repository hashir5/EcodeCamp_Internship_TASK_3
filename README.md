# Project Overview
This project focuses on Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering, an unsupervised machine learning technique aimed at grouping customers into distinct segments based on demographic and behavioral attributes. By identifying these segments, businesses can better understand their customer base and develop targeted marketing strategies to engage specific groups more effectively.

# Key Insights
The analysis uses K-Means Clustering to segment customers based on variables like age, annual income, spending score, and gender. The optimal number of clusters was determined using the Elbow Method, which resulted in 5 distinct customer segments. The segments were then visualized through scatter plots, allowing for a clear understanding of the behavioral and demographic differences between each group.

# Cluster Insights
Cluster 1: Younger customers with mid-range incomes and moderate spending scores. They exhibit average purchasing habits.
Cluster 2: Older, high-income customers with high spending scores, likely representing premium buyers or loyal customers.
Cluster 3: Customers with lower incomes and lower spending scores, indicating price sensitivity and the need for engagement strategies.
Other Clusters: Each cluster showcases unique demographic and spending behaviors that offer insight into how businesses can approach different customer groups.

# Recommendations
Target High-Value Customers: Focus on high-income, high-spending customers (Cluster 2) by providing personalized offers to maintain loyalty and drive retention.
Engage Price-Sensitive Customers: Implement cost-sensitive marketing strategies like discounts, promotions, or loyalty programs for Cluster 3 to increase engagement and minimize churn.
Tailored Marketing: Develop customized marketing campaigns for each segment to maximize profitability and customer satisfaction.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of K-Means Clustering in customer segmentation, providing actionable insights for businesses to refine their marketing efforts. By identifying key customer segments, businesses can move away from generic marketing approaches and deliver personalized experiences that cater to the specific needs of each group. This strategy will enhance customer retention, improve satisfaction, and boost profitability by aligning business offerings with customer preferences.
